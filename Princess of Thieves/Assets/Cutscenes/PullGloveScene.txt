Sir Samuel: Princess Elwynn?  All the gods and goddesses bless you!  You're alive.
Sir Samuel: In life, I was known as Sir Samuel of House Acaba, the Bard Knight.
Sir Samuel: I was famous for my ability to attract people to my side but what they didn't know was my secret item.
Sir Samuel: With my magnetic Pull Glove, I could draw enemies towards me and occasionally myself towards them.
Sir Samuel: I have no more need of it.  Please take it and escape this dragon's lair.

You got the Pull Glove.
Press [[RightItemKey]] to activate and aim with the [[AimKeys]] to pull against metal objects.
When you target movable objects, you'll bring them towards you and can move it with the Arrow Keys.
If you pull against immovable objects, you'll be the one pulled and can move around.
The gloves will stay attuned to a target for a brief period after releasing the key so you can tap the key to make precise movements.
