Sir Samuel: Princess Elwynn?  All the gods and goddesses bless you!  You're alive.
Sir Samuel: In life, I was known as Sir Samuel of House Acaba, the Bard Knight.
Sir Samuel: I was famous for my ability to attract people to my side but what they didn't know was my secret item.
Sir Samuel: With my magnetic Pull Glove, I could draw enemies towards me and occasionally myself towards them.
Sir Samuel: I have no more need of it.  Please take it and escape this dragon's lair.

You got the Pull Glove.
Press the Item Key to activate and aim with the Arrow Keys to pull against metal objects.
You'll pull light items to you but if you pull against immovable objects, you'll be the one pulled.
The gloves will stay attuned to a target for a brief period after releasing the key.
