Head Alchemist's Diary - 5/6/961 AB
I found some minion's in my personal lab.
It seems they passed out had passed out drunk just before they could sample some of the chemicals I keep in my vials.
They seem to have pilfered some of the Magic Capes Hogi had me craft for him along with a pair of my gloves from last night's celebration.
Curse those fools!  How many times do I have to remind them to stay out of my room.
They're just like my mother.
Anyways, it seems like using those capes, they managed to get more range that I expected out of those gloves.
I will have to adjust my traps accordingly.
