Sir Travis: Princess?  Gods shield you.  You're alive.
Sir Travis: I am Sir Travis, the Bright Knight of House Bailey.
Sir Travis: With my shiny Reflection Shield, I could reflect any projectile back at my opponents.
Sir Travis: I could even reflect the light of the Sun stronger than ever into their eyes but the door closed as soon as Sir Matthew went through it.
Sir Travis: For a second I was stunned and a projectile hit my back before I could raise my shield.
Sir Travis: Take it and escape.  May the light illumine you.
