Sir Christopher: Princess?  You're alive.  The gods truly are strong.
Sir Christopher: In life, I was known as Sir Christopher of House Strongarm, the Brawn Knight.
Sir Christopher: Everyone thought my ability to move myself and my enemies around was from my muscles...
Sir Christopher: But, no, it was truly from a magic item that has been passed down the Strongarm line for generations!
Sir Christopher: With my magnetic Push Glove, I would push myself and my enemies around making sure no one could get to me.
Sir Christopher: I have no more need of it.  Please take my true strength and use it to escape this dragon's lair.
