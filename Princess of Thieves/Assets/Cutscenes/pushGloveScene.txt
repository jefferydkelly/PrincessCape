Sir Liam: By the night's sky, you are alive.
Sir Liam: In life, I was known as Sir Liam of House Brien, the Sneak Knight.
Sir Liam: Thanks to my magic item, I was known for being wherever my enemies least suspected me.
Sir Liam: With my magnetic Push Glove, I would push myself and my enemies around making sure no one could get to me.
Sir Liam: I have no more need of it.  Please take it and escape this dragon's lair.
